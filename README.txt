Substrings is a program which allows the user to input a String, followed by a list of words which will be considered a dictionary.
The program will then check each word in the string with the list of words in the dictionary, 
creating a hash which compares the words in the dictionary with the number of occurences in the string.

To test, just load "./substrings.rb" and follow user prompt
